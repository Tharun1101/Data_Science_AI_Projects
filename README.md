# ðŸ§  Data Science & Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my portfolio of **Data Science**, **Machine Learning**, and **Deep Learning** projects. This repository serves as a central hub for my case studies, EDA exercises, and model-building work across various domains such as finance, e-commerce, computer vision, and marketing.

Iâ€™ll continue to update this repo with new projects as I explore more real-world problems.
